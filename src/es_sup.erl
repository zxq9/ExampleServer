%%% Example Server Supervisor
%%%
%%% The very top level supervisor in the system. It only has one service branch: the
%%% client handling service. In a more complex system the client handling service would
%%% only be one part of a larger system. Were this a game system, for example, the
%%% item data management service would be a peer, as would a login credential provision
%%% service, game world event handling, and so on.
